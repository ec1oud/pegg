------


The ps2pegg.awk script converts a plain PBM input bitmap into the
binary format that's expected by the PEGG program. The input bitmap can
be too big, since whitespace is cropped on all four sides of the image.

If that AWK converter is combined with the netpbm and ghostscript packages
it is possible to generate postscript print jobs to make labels out of every application.
The bash script shows how to convert a simple text string into
postscript (as an example) and then generates a label with the text.
With small changes, this can easily be added to an LPR configuration.
