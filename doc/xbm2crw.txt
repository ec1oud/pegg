To install xbm2crw just copy the xbm2crw file into a suitable location,
like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.

!! XBM Images must have a color depth of 1Bit !!

The usage of xbm2crw is straight forward. To convert an XBM image just type

	xbm2crw my_image.xbm

This will convert my_image.xbm to a raw file, which can be printed with pegg.
Due to compatibility reasons the format will be 512x64px. If you want to convert
an image of different format (for example: width=768, height=128px) then use xbm2crw
with optional arguments:

        xbm2crw 768 128 my_image.xbm
	
The raw file will now have the stated dimensions.
	
For your own labels you can use the template.xbm file. Which is of correct size
and color depth. (But only 521x64px)

Hopefully you have fun with xbm2crw, pegg and kpegg,

Daniel Amkreutz
