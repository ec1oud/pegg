This is a collection of utilities to enable printing to various USB Casio
label printers such as the KL-P1000 and KL-E11.

The main program is pegg, which finds your printer on the USB bus and sends
raw-formatted label files to it.

But you will need some help to generate the raw bitmap files.
scripts/xbm2crw can convert an XBM file to the raw format.

If you install netpbm and ghostscript and imagemagick, you can write a
Postscript file to format the label, use pstopnm to generate a PBM file,
use convert to generate an XBM file, use xbm2crw to generate the raw file
and finally send that to the printer.  scripts/peggps does this.  The
convention is that one Postscript point = 1 pixel (even though that's not
really to scale), so that you can think in pixels when designing the label.

If you also have a web server on the machine to which the printer is
connected, you can use the files under "web" to set up a convenient service
for printing labels from anywhere on your own LAN.  The web server will
need to be set up to handle CGI scripts.  Of course it is possible to
customize those scripts to generate custom labels with extra decorations,
multiple text fields in various places, etc.

Alternatively you can set up the printer with a CUPS driver so that it's
available as a network printer, and use any program you like to send
Postscript to it.  (But you'd better limit the "page" size to 512 x 64
"points".)
