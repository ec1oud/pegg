1) INSTALLATION

Pegg uses libusb >= 0.1.7(!) (libusb.sourceforge.net)
In order to install Pegg 0.23 make sure that you have installed libusb with headers
(meaning you have a file named usb.h on you machine).
Before using the make command please check the path given in the makefile. After
you checked everything just type the folowing to build and install pegg

	make
	make install

This will install pegg into the path given in the PREFIX Variable in the Makefile
and copies the manpage into the manpath.
If you would like to clean the projectpath then type

	make clean

Note for KP-C50:
You first have to modify the source according to the way described in line 247 of pegg.c
Please keep in mind, that the KP-C50 will be used exclusively by X when it is used as 
a mouse also. If you want to use this device with pegg, you will have to choose another
pointing device in X, such that the printer is available for pegg.



2) TESTING

After the installation you may test pegg by doing the folowing:

1. Connect your printer.

2. Try a pegg -t to see if pegg recognizes your printer. You should see the type of your printer
   in the output. (You will have to be loged in as root in order to scan the USB)

3. If pegg has found your printer print a test label using the test_raw file. To do so type in
   this command:

   pegg -d4 ./test_raw
  
The printer should now print a label with some text on it. 
If you have completed these steps you are doone with the installation.
